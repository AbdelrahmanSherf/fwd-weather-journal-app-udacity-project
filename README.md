# Project Description
Weather-Journal App is a **web-based weather application** that uses [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org)'s Weather [API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get the weather data based on the entered **Zip Code**. *NOTE: For now it's for US only.*     
In addition to **fetching** the weather data, it also **takes some feedback** from the user and **stores it in a NodeJs server endpoint to retrieve it later** and **dynamically display it** to the user.
